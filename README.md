This is the python code of the paper "Adversarial Training for Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems"

use this file : "NSL-KDD adversarial attack and training.py"  to experiment or modify settings and run the code

Here you will find multiple python codes to prepocess and try adversarial attacks on The BoT-IoT and NSL-KDD Dataset

( link to download the BoT-IoT dataset: https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/bot_iot.php )

Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) - Python Library for Machine Learning Security - Evasion, Poisoning, Extraction, Inference was used for the tests
